This module provides a function for displaying a popup notification on the Tesla navigation display
showing a hazard hotspot and heatmap based on other drivers' CleanApp reports in a given location.

If more than 100 drivers generate a CleanApp report about a particular hazard, within 500m of that hazard,
in the past 1 hour, the function will display the hazard popup and notify first responders.
